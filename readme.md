# LifeHack Project 
This is a simple project to test user choices in order to reach a spcific goal at the end of the questions.  
* Each question has two possible answers  
* Each answer opens up a question with two new questions  
* At the end of the process the User should know which path he chosen  
* The system should `persist` the user choices
